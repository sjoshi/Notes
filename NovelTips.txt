 One other thing I would like to add is that I chose the 6x9 format and 11 Font Garamond. 
 I fooled around with the various fonts and sizes and found that this one worked very well. 
 Another comment from the readers who bought it was that they could read it "without reading glasses.

I bought mine on dreamstime.com for about $6.  You have full rights to the photo.  
Mind you anyone else that buys it also has rights to it.  My book is Chocolate is Healthy!

Hi! You should check out www.deviantart.com - it is a huge artist community. 
Find a bunch of people whose style you like, send them a polite note (private msg) 
asking if they do commissions for a book cover, and for how much. 
You may have to ask a lot to get the 2-3 people that are interested and available. 

 
To save money, I do my own covers, but here are some links you could try:

Writing Tips
------------

Nouns:
	Only proper nouns (refer to one in particular) require an initial capital. 
So it is correct to write "a police sergant" but "Sergent Jenkins", "a 
school", but "Middleton High School".

	Pronouns are words used in place of a nouns, to avoid continually repeating 
it - like she, they, him and everyone. Pronouns such as everybody, anyone 
and someone are nowadays always written as a single word. be careful to 
avoid confusing these pronouns with situations where two words which would 
comprise a pronoun appear side-by-side but separately:

		She looked at all the rings, and rejected every one.
		Any one correct answer is good.
	
	It would be incorrect to write "everyone" and "anyone"

Conjunction:
	These are short words (and, but, or) used to join two other words, phrases 
or clauses.

	One mistake seen is the so called comma-splice, where a comma is used to 
shunt together two separate sentences. For example:
		
		I like these flowers, they are called Aquilegia.
	
	This is wrong since 2 independent clauses cannot be linked by a comma. To 
make it correct, you can insert a conjunction after the comma, or substitute 
a semi-colon or a period.

		I like these flowers; they are called Aquilegia.
		George wanted to by a clock, but Lucky persuaded him not to.
		George wanted to by a clock. Lucky persuaded him not to.


Subjects & Objects:
	A sentence may also have an object showing what the action described by the 
verb was performed upon.

		The dog [subject] ate [verb] its breakfast [object].

	Understanding this distinction is important, as many pronouns differ 
according to whether the are being used as the subject or the object, e.g. 
he(subject)/him(object), we(subject)/us(object). 
	
	A common mistake is to use the subjective "I" where the objective "me" is 
required.
		
		George gave the list to Fred and I (should be "Fred and me").


Ellipses:

They are used to show a passage from which some words or sentences have been 
left out. Ellipses are often used in reporting quotes in articles and news 
stories.

	Inspector Davis said: "After a poor response to our initial appeal...a 
number"

This indicates that some words the inspector said have been omitted. It is also 
used to indicate a hesitation in mid-sentence:
	
	"Do you think...he's gone?"

They can also show a speech which trails off:
	
	"He may have. On the other hand..."


Semi-colons:

Their roll falls somewhere between a period and a comma. One important use is in 
separating items in a list, especially when some items include additional 
information.
		
	"Bring me an apple; two oranges, not too ripe; three large bannanas or four 
small ones; and a bunch of grapes."

Semi-colons have another important use in separating two independent clauses 
which are too closely linked for a period.

	"It was his first goal for the club; he was pleased as punch."


Finally, semi-colons can be used to introduce an independent clause preceded by 
an adverb (e.g. however, then, so).
		
	Jane wondered if it would rain; then she shrugged and went away.
	It was too late to retreat; so they advanced.

An independent clause is one containing a subject and a verb and expressing one 
complete thought or idea.


Colons:

Colons are most often used to introduce lists, especially where the items are 
separated by semi-colons. They can also be used as an alternative to commas for 
introducing direct speech. (He said: "It's time we were going").

Colons can also introduce an explanation or amplification of the preceding 
material.
	
	Good punctuation matters: without it writing may not make sense.
	He knew what the signal meant: success.
	He knew what the signal meant: it was time to go.


Commas:

Commas signal a short break and should ensure that the meaning of the sentence 
is clean and unambiguous.

One common use of commas is to offset a phrase or clause from the main sentence.
	
	He felt, despite everything, it was best to accept Mark's offer.

Another is to place a comma unnecessarily between the subject of a sentence and 
its verb:
	
	Even the ever-punctilious Goerge Evans, couldn't argue with that.

Another common mistake, in fiction writing, is omission of the vocative comma. 
This is always required where someone is addressed directly in dialog:
	
	"Hello, Mary."
	"Good morning, my dear."
	"Mary, I've been meaning to ask you something."

If vocative comma seems superfluos to you, just consider the difference in 
meaning between "What's up, Jane?" and "What's up Jane?"


Apostrophes
	A simple foolproof test exists. Rephrase the expression using the word "of". 
thus the example is "the bedroom of the girls". The correct position of the 
apostrophe is after the final letter of the rephrased version. In our 
example this is an "s", so the correct version is "the girls' bedroom".


Dashes

A pair may be used to parenthesize a phrase - like this - as an alternative to 
commas or brackets.
A dash can also be used to signal a sudden or surprising twist at the end of a 
sentence:
	
	He sat down and breathed a sigh of relief - then the door handle turned.

Finally, a dash at end of a speech can be used as a signal that the speaker is 
interrupted or stops abruptly.

	"I can't possibly-"
	"Oh yes, you can!"



Hyphens:

There are some constructions in which hyphens are required. These include:

	- Words begining with prefixes such as ex, ant and non - ex-husband, 
anti-aircraft, etc.
	- Fraction and numbers - two-thirds, three-quarters, one-and-a-half
	-Adjectives formed from two or more words - left-wing groups, a ten-year-old 
child, a punch-drunk boxer.
	-Nouns in which two or more words are joined to form a single expression - 
ear-ring, curtain-raiser.
	-Expressions such as two-, three- or four-fold where the hyphen is used to 
avoid repetition.


Writing Dialog:

Every change of speaker requires a new paragraph.
	
	"It's a beautiful day," she said. "What a shame we have to go to work."
	"It certainly is," he replied.

But if no-one else has spoken in the paragraph, it may be better to run the 
dialog straight on.
	
	He glanced around the room. "It's not much to look at, is it?" he said.

When someone is addressed directly in a dialog, the name they are addressed by 
must be offset by a comma.

	"It's a beautiful day, John," she said.

Where a he said or similar follows, the speech itself must close with a comma, 
exclamation or question mark, but never a full stop:
	
	"You always say that," he said.
	"It's beautiful!" she said.

Writers sometimes forget that the period at the end of a speech also serves as 
the period for the sentence. So this final full stop is unnecessary here...

	"George said, "It's eight o'clock.".

You should also capitalize the first word of a quoted sentence, even if it is 
preceded by a "jack said" or similar.
	
	Jack said, "What time do you make it now?"

All proper nouns require an initial capital. Proper nouns are nouns that 
identify a particular person, place or business.

Capitalize a title when it precedes before their name.

	President Bush gave a speech.
	Clare Gomex, the chairperson of the company, arrived later.

When a civil title is used as a name, it takes lower case:
	
	The president met up with the British prime minister for lunch.

When someone is addressed directly by their title in speech, initial capitals 
should normally be used.
	
	"Could you explain that for me again, Professor?"
	"Look what I made at school today, Daddy!"


Whom/Who:

If you want him, write whom; if you want he, write who.

So for example:
	
	Who do you think is responsible? (Do you think he is responsible?)
	Whom shall we ask to the party? (Shall we ask him to the part?)


Whoever/Whomever:

Choosing between whoever and whomever is tricker. Use these two rules to guide 
you.

Rule 1: First of all, use the ever suffix when who or whom can fit into two
clauses in the sentence.

	Give it to whoever/whomever asks for it first.
	Give it to him. He asks for it first.

Rule 2: To decide on whoever and whomever:
	
	him + he = whoever
	him + him = whomever

So in the first example, the first clause contains him and the second he. So 
whoever is correct here.
	
	Give it to whoever asks for it first.
