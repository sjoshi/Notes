.NET Internationalization
===========================

Windows Multilingual User Interface Pack:-

	Windows Multilingual User Interface (MUI) Pack is a collection of resource 
files that can be added to the English version of Windows 2000, XP, and 
2003. Windows MUI is installed after the installation of a regular 
English-language version of Windows. You can choose as many languages as you 
want from any of the localized languages (33 languages in Windows XP MUI)

	The Japanese resources are loaded from a resource file with the same name as 
the executable, with a ".mui" suffix, in the %WINDOWS%\mui\FALLBACK\ <LCID> 
folder. The LCID (locale ID) for "Japanese (Japan)" is 1041 (x0411).
	So you would have a wordpad.exe.mui in the above folder for resources that 
are Japanese.

	However, some important differences exist. These are either advantageous or 
disadvantageous, depending on what you want to use Windows MUI for. First, the 
default fonts shown are the defaults for English Windows XP, not Japanese 
Windows XP. Second, the Input Method Editor (IME, software that allows the user 
to type ideo-graphic or phonetic characters on a keyboard that does not have 
such characters) is not enabled by default. Although you can easily add IME 
support (see Chapter 7, "Middle East and East Asian Cultures"), this isn't 
something that a developer who is unfamiliar with Japanese would think to do.

.NET Framework Languages and .NET Framework Language Packs
	
	We start by looking at the .NET Framework 2.0. The .NET Framework 2.0 
redistributable package, dotnetfx.exe, is a single package that supports all 
languages. The dotnetfx.exe that you download from the English page is 100% 
identical to the dotnetfx.exe that you download from the French page. The 
difference lies only in the fact that the English page has instructions in 
English and the French page has instructions in French. 

The package itself, however, contains the complete user interface resources for 
all supported languages. The important point to grasp here is that the .NET 
Framework that is installed is always the English version of the .NET Framework.

You might wonder how you can get localized versions of all the text in the .NET 
Framework. Enter .NET Framework Language Packs. .NET Framework Language Packs 
include text and other resources for languages other than English. 

The language pack files have the same name for each language, so you must create 
separate directories or rename them. You can install as many language packs on 
the same machine as you need. Your .NET application will use the resources from 
the language pack according to the current setting of the 
System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture property.


Cultures:-
	
	A culture is a language and, optionally, a region. In the .NET Framework, it 
is represented by the System.Globalization.CultureInfo class.

	Typically, a culture is created from a culture string. The culture string is 
specified in the RFC 1766 format:

		languagecode2[-country/regioncode2[-script]]

	languagecode2 is an ISO 639-1 or 639-2 code, country/regioncode2 is an ISO 
3166 code, and script is the writing system used to represent text in the 
country/region (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic). 
	
	For example, the following code creates a CultureInfo object for the English 
language:

		CultureInfo cultureInfo = new CultureInfo("en");

	CultureInfo objects are classified as either invariant, neutral, or 
specific. The invariant culture, represented by an empty string, is intended 
to represent the absence of any given culture.

	CultureInfo objects have a Parent property so that the "en-US" specific 
culture knows that its parent is the "en" neutral culture which, in turn, 
knows that its Parent is the invariant culture. This hierarchy is essential 
for the fallback process described later in this chapter.


Localizable Strings:-

	To make code localizable we need to place the string in some other container 
that can changed at runtimes. .NET has .resx files for this that can 
contain resources such as strings and bitmaps.

	Name the resource file as the source file to which it relates. So if you 
have a TaxCalc.cs, name the corresponding resource file as 
TaxCalcResources.resx. 

	VS2005 windows forms applications have a default resource file called 
Resources.resx which is for your own use.

	Select the Form1Resources.resx file in Solution Explorer and take a look at 
it in the Properties Window. The Build Action property says that it is an 
Embedded Resource. This means that Visual Studio will identify the correct 
compiler for this resource type, compile it, and embed the result in the 
generated assembly. The correct compiler for resx files is a built-in 
version of resgen.exe. A "resources" file is a binary version of an XML resx 
file. Visual Studio embeds the compiled output in the generated assembly 
using a build task that is a wrapper for the Assembly Linker. 
	
	The result is a file called "Form1Resources.resources" that contains the 
compiled resources. 

	At this stage, we have a WindowsApplication1.exe assembly that has an 
embedded resource called "WindowsApplication1.Form1Resources.resources," 
which contains a single string called "InsufficientFunds," which has a value 
of "Insufficient funds for the transfer." We need a way to retrieve this 
string from the embedded resource.


Using French Strings:-

	To reap the rewards of our work, we need to offer a second or third 
language. In this example, we add French to the list of supported languages. 
This is where the culture strings that we discussed earlier come in. The 
culture string for neutral French is "fr." Create a new Resource File so 
that the complete filename is Form1Resources.fr.resx. Into this resource 
file, add a new string, using the same name as before, "InsufficientFunds"; 
into the Value field this time, though, type the French equivalent of 
"Insufficient funds for the transfer" ("Fonds insuffisants pour le 
transfert").

	Compile the application and inspect the output folder. You will find a new 
folder called "fr" beneath the output folder. If the output folder is 
\WindowsApplication1\bin\Debug, you will find 
WindowsApplication1\bin\Debug\fr. In this folder you will find a new 
assembly with the same name as the application, but with the extension 
".resources.dll" (i.e., WindowsApplication1.resources.dll).

	The Form1Resources.fr.resx file has been compiled and embedded in this new 
assembly. This new assembly is a resources assembly, and it contains 
resources only. This assembly is referred to as a satellite assembly


CurrentCulture & CurrentUICulture:-
	
	Two properties that determine the default internationalization behavior of 
an application are: CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture. Both properties can 
be accessed either from the current thread or from the CultureInfo class, 
but they can be assigned only from the current thread.

	CurrentCulture is culture-specific, not culture-neutral. That is, the value 
includes a region as well as a language. CurrentCulture defaults to the 
Win32 function GetUserDefaultLCID. This value is set in the Regional and 
Language Options Control Panel applet.
	
	If you consider that this value determines issues such as date/time formats 
and the number and currency formats, you can understand that it is 
meaningless to assign a "French" culture to CurrentCulture because French in 
Canada has completely different globalization values to French in France. It 
represents the default culture for all classes in System.globalization and 
thus affects issues such as culture-specific formatting like in date-time, 
number-currency, pasring and sorting.

	In general, your application should strive to acquire a specific culture for 
the CurrentCulture, but there is an option to manufacture a specific 
culture, which can be considered a last resort. The 
CultureInfo.Create-SpecificCulture method accepts a culture and returns a 
specific culture from it. So if you pass it "fr" for French, you get a 
culture for French in France. 

	On the other hand the property of the thread that has to do with 
language/translations etc is CurrentUICulture. The CurrentUICulture, 
however, defaults to the Win32 function GetUserDefaultUILanguage. This value 
is usually determined by the user interface language version of the 
operating system and cannot be changed. So if you install the French version 
of Windows, GetUserDefaultUILanguage returns French; therefore, 
CurrentUICulture defaults to French.

	CurrentUICulture represents the default culture used by ResourceManager 
methods and thus affects the retrieval of user interface resources such as  
strings and bitmaps. The CurrentUICulture can be culture-neutral, 
culture-specific, or the invariant culture

	This line creates a new CultureInfo object for neutral French.

		Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("fr");


Fallback Assembly:-
	
	We have System.Resources.Neutral-ResourcesLanguageAttribute. The 
NeutralResourcesLanguage attribute enables you to declare the culture of the 
main assembly. The purpose of this is to save unnecessary searching for 
resource assemblies. You use it like this:

		[assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute("en-US")]

	This line can go anywhere (for example, at the top of Form1.cs), but it is 
best placed with other similar assembly attributes in AssemblyInfo.cs. With 
this attribute in place when CurrentUICulture is en-US, 
ResourceManager.GetString looks in the main assembly immediately without 
performing unnecessary lookups in the en-US or en folders. In Visual Studio 
2005, you can set this same attribute in the Assembly Information dialog 
(click the Assembly Information... button in the Application tab of the 
project's properties).


Culture Info:-

	Two cultures use nonstandard culture string formats: zh-CHS (Chinese 
(Simplified)) and zh-CHT (Chinese (Traditional)). Looking at these strings, 
you would expect them to represent specific cultures ("zh" being a language 
and "CHS"/"CHT" being a country), but they do not. Instead, they are both 
neutral cultures and are parents to zh-CN (Chinese (People's Republic of 
China)) and zh-TW (Chinese (Taiwan)), respectively. 
	
	For this reason, you should take care to use the 
CultureInfo.IsNeutralCulture property to determine whether a culture is 
neutral instead of making an inference by parsing the culture's name. This 
property is similarly important when considering custom cultures because 
there is no requirement that the name of a custom culture follow a strict 
<language>-<region> format. 
	
	Note that there is no CultureInfo.IsSpecificCulture property, so the 
implication is that if IsNeutralCulture is false, the culture is specific. 
This is true for all cultures except CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, which is 
neither neutral nor specific (although it can behave like a specific 
culture). You can test a culture to see if it is the invariant culture by 
making a comparison with CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.


Sort Orders:-

	String.CompareOrdinal is similar to String.Compare, but it performs the 
comparison based upon the Unicode code points of each character in the 
string and returns the "magnitude" of the difference. For example, 
String.CompareOrdinal("a", "·") returns -128. The Unicode code point of the 
letter "a" is U+0061 (97), and the Unicode code point of the letter "·" is 
U+00E1 (225). The result is 97 225 (i.e., 128). There are several benefits 
to using String.CompareOrdinal: It is culture-insensitive (because it uses 
Unicode code points) and it is faster than other comparison methods. It 
should also be noted that String.CompareOrdinal compares all characters in a 
string, whereas other comparison methods are dependent upon characters being 
defined in the .NET Framework's sorting tables. This means that if a 
comparison is performed using String.Compare and is passed the invariant 
culture, characters that are not in the .NET Framework's sorting tables will 
simply be ignored.

	For these reasons, Microsoft recommends using an ordinal comparison for 
culture-insensitive comparisons. Additionally, it should be noted that 
although the actual sort itself is unlikely to yields results that are 
culturally significant for any particular culture, it can still be useful 
for maintaining ordered lists that require fast searching.
	
	The .NET Framework 2.0 supports the creation of cultures for an alternate 
sort order using a language and region suffixed with the alternate sort 
order:

		CultureInfo cultureInfo = new CultureInfo("es-ES_tradnl");


DateTime & Calendars:-

	The DateTime structure holds the date/time information as a culture-agnostic 
point in time in the form of ticks and as such it is not dependent on any 
culture.
	The DateTime structure accepts calendar objects in its constructor for the 
sole purpose of interpreting the year, month and the day passed to the 
constructor.

	The DateTimeFormatInfo class contains date-time formatting information. It 
has a read-write Calendar property from which it can draw information about 
how any given point in time is represented in a particular calendar.

	Here the CultureInfo's calendar is changed to Japaneses using it's 
DateTimeFormat property.

		CultureInfo japCulture = new CultureInfo("ja-JP");
		jap.DateTimeFormat.Calendar = new JapaneseCalendar();

		DateTime jan2000 = new DateTime(2000, 1, 1, new GregorianCalendar());

		Console.WriteLine(jan2000.ToString(japCulture));
		//Outputs  12/1/1 0:00:00

		
International Domain Name Mapping:-

	When the World Wide Web was first developed, the Domain Name Service upon 
which it is based was rooted firmly in the ASCII character set. This meant 
that all domain names had to conform to 7-bit ASCII. This tiny range (U+0000 
to U+007f) covers the English language and very few others. The problem 
faced by the rest of the world was how to create domain names that used 
characters outside of this range yet still worked with the antiquated ASCII 
DNS.
		
	IdnMapping idnMapping = new IdnMapping();
	textBoxASCII.Text = idnMapping.GetAscii(textBoxIDN.Text);


	When the button is pressed, the ASCII TextBox is filled with the encoded 
domain name "http://www.xni18ncaf-hya.com". The second "Go" button contains 
the following code:

	webBrowser1.Navigate(textBoxASCII.Text);
	string programFilesFolder =	Environment.GetFolderPath(									Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFiles);


Font Selection:-

	 In terms of code point range coverage, Arial Unicode MS (installed with 
some Microsoft Office applications) has one of the largest. One of the 
limitations of the Font Properties Extension is that it cannot show 
additional tabs for Font Collections. A Font Collection (.TTC) is a file 
that is a collection of fonts. You can overcome this limitation by breaking 
down collections into individual font files using BREAKTTC.EXE (from the 
Microsoft TrueType Font SDK). The Font Properties Extension simply works 
with font files anywhere, so you don't have to extract the files to the 
system's font directory.

	Font substitution is of interest in the localization process because of two 
font face names: MS Shell Dlg and MS Shell Dlg 2. These font face names are 
set to different fonts for different versions of Windows and different 
language versions of Windows. The MS Shell Dlg 2 font face name is intended 
to be used with Windows 2000 and above.

	The benefit of using one of these font face names in your application is 
that your application is abstracted from the problem of choosing a font 
directly, and this choice can be delayed until runtime. The disadvantage of 
using a font face name instead of a physical font name is that substituted 
fonts are not visible in the Properties Windows in Visual Studio and cannot 
be set in the Properties Window. Instead, they must be set in code:

		public Form1()
		{
			Font = new Font("MS Shell Dlg 2", 12);
			InitializeComponent();
		}


	The same comments as before about using a form base class apply equally 
here. An alternative to this approach is to use the 
StandardPropertiesResourceMan-ager in Chapter 12, "Custom Resource 
Managers," which can assign the same value to every property (e.g., Font) 
that is loaded as a resource.

Font Linking:-
	
	By default, on Windows XP Professional SP2, there are no font links, but 
there is nothing to stop you from adding your own. In the Registry, add new 
keys to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFT WARE\Microsoft\Windows 
NT\CurrentVersion\FontLink\SystemLink, where the key name is the name of the 
font and the value is the names of the fonts that it is linked to. If you 
install East Asian support (in the Regional and Language Options dialog, 
select the Languages tab, check the "Install files for East Asian languages" 
check box, and click OK), several entries are created.

	You can see from this that by installing East Asian support, the Microsoft 
Sans Serif font has been font-linked to the MSGOTHIC, gulim, SimSun, and 
mingliu True-Type Collections.

	In localization terms, this means that we can use a single font, such as 
Microsoft Sans Serif or Tahoma, and rely upon it being extended to include 
the glyphs that we need for other Unicode code ranges.

	When a font does not have a glyph for a requested code point, the "not 
defined" glyph (a box) is displayed instead.

	The moral of this story is that you can use a single font throughout your 
application for many different languages if it either supports all of those 
languages or is linked to other fonts to support those languages.

Exception Messages:-

	The simplest way to localize this text is to let the .NET Framework do the 
work for you:

		throw new ArgumentException();

In the absence of a supplied message, the .NET Framework gets a message 
using its own ResourceManager. Consequently, the actual message retrieved is 
dependent upon CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture and the .NET Framework Language 
Packs installed on the machine. So if the CurrentUICulture is "de-DE" 
(German (Germany)) and the German .NET Framework Language Pack is installed, 
the exception message will be "Der Wert liegt auﬂerhalb des erwarteten 
Bereichs." 
	
One problem that this raises is that the localization of exception messages 
is clearly limited to the availability of .NET Framework Language Packs for the 
current culture. So .NET Framework 1.1 exception messages on Arabic Windows are 
in English because the fallback culture for the .NET Framework is English.
	
To create exceptions with localized messages, you either use the default 
exception constructor or pass null for the message parameter:

		throw new FileNotFoundException();
		throw new FileNotFoundException(null);

The .NET Framework and the installed Language Pack provide the localized 
exception message. To create exceptions with English messages, you can still 
use the default constructor or pass null for the message parameter, but you 
set the Current UICulture before creating the exception:


		Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("en-US");
		throw new IOException();
		throw new IOException(null);

	Exceptions that are thrown by the .NET Framework or by third-party code 
(including COM objects, for example) are outside of your control, and .NET 
exception messages will be localized regardless of the intended recipient of 
the message.


Psuedo Translation:-
	
As part  of internationalization  process, you will  want to  test how
localizable  your application  is. Pseudo  translation  is translation
that modifies the original text so that the original text can still be
inferred from the translated text.
	
The option that I have chosen is to convert to accented
characters. In this approach, each character is converted to an
equivalent character that has an accent.

A general rule is that, for text less than 10 characters, the
text needs to be padded by an additional 400 percent; for text greater
than or equal to 10 characters, the text needs to be padded by an
additional 30 percent

Choosing a Culture for Pseudo Translation:-
	
	To use pseudo translation, you must identify a culture that represents the 
pseudo language. 
	
	You can create a custom culture if you are using VS2005, ASPNET or not using 
resx files for resources or if you are unable to create a custom culture for 
pseudo translation, the alternative is to hijack an existing culture. In 
this approach, you identify a language/country that you do not expect to 
ever use for its real purpose and hijack it for your own purpose.

	Regardless of whether you create a custom culture or hijack an existing 
culture, you need a means by which you can communicate your chosen culture 
to code that needs to know the pseudo culture. The following 
PseudoTranslation class has a static property that represents a global 
placeholder for your chosen pseudo translation culture ("sq" is the language 
code for Albanian):

		public class PseudoTranslation
		{
			private static CultureInfo cultureInfo = new CultureInfo("sq");
			public static CultureInfo CultureInfo
			{
				get {return cultureInfo;}
				set {cultureInfo = value;}
			}
		}



Custom Culture:-
	
	Creating a custom culture involves:
		- Defining the custom culture
		- Registering the custom culture
