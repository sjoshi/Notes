Using GIT
---------

The sequence for reverting to the last committed version is:

	- If already commited:
		$ git revert HEAD 	//Revert to last commited version
		$ git revert HEAD^	//Revert to next-to-last revision
		
	- If modified & then added to staging area:
		$ git reset HEAD filename
		$ git checkout filename
	
	- If only modified then:
		$ git reset --hard HEAD  	//Replaces everything
		$ git checkout filename		//Reverts only one file

 I have the following section in my .gitconfig file:
[alias]
st = status
di = diff
co = checkout
ci = commit
br = branch
sta = stash

.NET Git Ignore
---------------
#OS junk files
[Tt]humbs.db
*.DS_Store

#Visual Studio files
[Oo]bj/
[Bb]in/
*.suo
*.user
/TestResults
*.vspscc
*.vssscc

# Office Temp Files
~$*

Setup a global excludes files:
	git config --global core.excludefile ~/.gitignore
	
	
In the prompt, type “git init”:
Then issue "git add ."

I just turned my folder into a git repository.  Really that easy?
Yep.  Notice the folder mentioned in the response to the command.  The
.git folder.  For the subversion users who are reading: Remember how
you’d have a .svn folder under every directory of your repository?
Not with git.  You only have the one .git folder.  If you delete that,
you’re folder is no longer a git repository.  Yes, it’s that easy.

Also, notice the “(master)” on the end of our prompt.  That is a nice
feature of msysgit.  It is telling me what git branch I’m are
currently in.

$ git add test.pl
$ git ci -m ‘initial import’
Created initial commit 219c5b3: initial import
1 files changed, 6 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
create mode 100644 test.pl

At this point, we want to create a branch so we can refactor this mess without ruining the working code.

$ git co -b refactor
Switched to a new branch “refactor”

Now that we’re on the refactor branch, let’s sequester the print statement into a subroutine.

And commit:
This command will add and commit at the same time with a message

$ git commit -a -m ‘factor print into a subroutine’;
