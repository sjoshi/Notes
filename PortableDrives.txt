Portable Drives
===============


I would just like to mention the connector (and cable) on the drive is not really proprietary.

It uses a Micro-B USB 3.0 Compatible connector. You can actually take a 
USB Micro-B Male to USB A Male cable and plug this into your computer 
in USB 2.0 mode. I personally used the cable for my smartphone and it worked just fine.

Edit: I just uploaded an image of this to the gallery.
